Clean money, dirty money, respect, fear, heat level, jail, contacts, loans, stocks, passive income and what not!
✅ Depth:
Clean money, dirty money, respect, fear, heat level, jail, contacts, loans, stocks, passive income — that’s layers of economy, risk management, and player choice.
This feels like early Mafia Manager meets tiny GTA clicker.

✅ Gameplay Variety:
Crime tree unlocks, laundering methods, contacts upgrades, random events (raids, booms, betrayals) — this isn’t just “commit crime, get rich.” It forces player decisions, resource management, timing.

✅ Replayability:
Risk increases over time. Heat rises. Debt spirals. Bribes get expensive. Events are randomized.
No two runs will play out exactly the same.

✅ Personality & Tone:
The emojis, slang ("Loan sharks sent a message", "BUSTED", "Underground casino needs investors"), it feels alive, not sterile. That's important for immersion.
